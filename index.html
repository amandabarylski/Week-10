            It always extended outside of the form background, and I'm not sure why.
            I adjusted margins on both it and the form itself and it always grew to extend just past the form.
            Some of my changes made it worse, but none of them removed the problem.
            It looks good when the screen is large, but it's annoying that it won't shrink as much as the 
            rest of the content inside the form.
            However, I did get it to display horizontally with the rest of the content when the screen is large,
            which is not what it defaulted to.-->
